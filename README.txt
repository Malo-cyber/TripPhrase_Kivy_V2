App aim : Trip phrase is a contextual dictionnary that allow you to use and learn contextual phrase during a trip in a 
foreign country when you don't have the time to learn all the language of the country

How To Build : 
- install all requierment in requirement.txt
- since no external backend allowed the application database to be fullfiled when connect,
import the exemple data by editing main.py -> MainApp.on_start() 

#import = Importer(r'./data/dicty/Slovene_french/', 'Slovene', 'French')
#import.create_instance()

Think to remove this line for the next run, in order to avoid any duplication of data in database
